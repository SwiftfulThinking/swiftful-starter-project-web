# Project Overview

This is a Next.js 15.3.4 starter template with comprehensive shadcn/ui components and advanced theming.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Next.js 15.3.4 with App Router
- Language: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode  
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- UI Components: shadcn/ui (all 46 components pre-installed)
- Animations: Lottie animations via lottie-react
- Video Player: react-player for YouTube, Vimeo, and direct video URLs
- Authentication: Firebase Auth with Firestore user profiles
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- AI Integration: OpenAI API (Chat & Reasoning models)
- State Management: React Context (auth only) + local state
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- Themes: next-themes + custom theme system

## Core Principles
1. Client-Side First: All pages use 'use client' directive - no server components
2. No API Routes: All data operations use Firebase client SDK directly  
3. TypeScript Strict Mode: No explicit any types except in error catches
4. Component Library: Use existing shadcn/ui components before creating custom ones

## Project Structure
- App Router: Uses Next.js 15 app directory structure
- Component Library: All shadcn/ui components in /src/components/ui/
- Theme System: Centralized color management in /src/lib/theme-colors.ts
- TypeScript: Path alias @/* â†’ ./src/*
