# What NOT to Do

## Avoid These Patterns
1. No Server Components: Don't remove 'use client' directives
2. No API Routes: Don't create /app/api routes - use Firebase directly
3. No New Icon Libraries: Use lucide-react exclusively
4. No CSS Files: Don't create .css or .module.css files
5. No Default Exports: Use named exports for all components
6. No Global State: Keep state local or use Context sparingly
7. No Custom Fetch Wrappers: Use Firebase SDK methods directly
8. No Env Vars Without Prefix: All must start with NEXT_PUBLIC_

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't forget to add new pages to the sidebar navigation
- Don't hardcode colors - use theme CSS variables
- Don't skip loading states - every async operation needs feedback
- Don't use any type - define proper interfaces
- Don't commit .env.local file
- Don't forget isActive prop on sidebar menu items
- Don't use regular <a> tags for internal navigation

## Important Reminders
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files
- Only create documentation files if explicitly requested
