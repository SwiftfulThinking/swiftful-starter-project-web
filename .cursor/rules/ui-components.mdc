# UI Components & Pages

## Working with Components
All shadcn/ui components follow consistent patterns:
- Located in /src/components/ui/
- Use Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Styled with Tailwind CSS classes
- Support theme colors via CSS variables

## Sidebar Navigation
- Structure: Every authenticated page must include the sidebar
- Active States: Set isActive prop on current page's menu item  
- User Footer: Shows profile picture, name, email, and settings popover

## Navigation Patterns
- Programmatic: Use router.push() from next/navigation
- Links in Sidebar: Use Next.js <Link> component
- External Links: Add target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

## Custom Components

### ResponsiveLottie Component
```tsx
import { ResponsiveLottie } from "@/components/ui/responsive-lottie"

// Loop animation
<ResponsiveLottie 
  url="https://example.com/animation.json" 
  playbackMode="loop"
  className="h-48" 
/>
```

### ResponsivePlayer Component  
```tsx
import { ResponsivePlayer } from "@/components/ui/responsive-player"

// YouTube video with controls
<ResponsivePlayer 
  url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" 
  controls={true}
  className="h-64"
/>
```

## Theme System
- Central theme configuration in /src/lib/theme-colors.ts
- 4 pre-built themes with light/dark variants
- Uses HSL color format
- Theme changes apply instantly to all components
