# Commit Style Guidelines

**Note: Only apply these rules when explicitly asked to "commit"**

When explicitly asked to commit changes:
- Generate commit messages automatically based on staged changes without additional user confirmation
- Commit all changes in a single commit
- Keep commit messages short - only a few words long
- Do NOT include "Co-Authored-By" or any references to Claude/AI in commit messages

## Commit Message Format:
- [Feature] Add some button - For new functionality or components
- [Bug] Fix some bug - For bug fixes and corrections  
- [Clean] Refactored some code - For refactoring, cleanup, or code improvements

## Examples:
- [Feature] Add user dashboard
- [Bug] Fix login validation
- [Clean] Refactor project manager
